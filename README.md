stacksmashlab
===============================================================================

This is a lab assignment I developed for a course on Computer Security during 
spring 2014.  The main aim is for the student to reflect on the principles and 
requirements for trusted computing.  In this scenario the adversary cannot 
modify the system code being run.

`make stacksmash.pdf` will generate the PDF containing the instruction.  `make 
passwd` will compile the binary for the simple passwd utility to attack.
